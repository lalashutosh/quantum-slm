            "reference": "Coherent errors are unitary errors meaning that they can be expressed as unitary operations performed on the quantum state. In practice, coherent errors appear as over or under rotations of a quantum gate [16]. In the coherent approach every shot within the bound ϵ is random but consistent. This means that we get the same error for a gate operation every time for that particular run. This translates to a consistent miscalibration that causes distortion in the kernel matrix"
