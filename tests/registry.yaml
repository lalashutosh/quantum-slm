    question: "What is the relationship between the feature map and the RKHS?"
    concepts: ["Hilbert space", "mapping", "inner product"]
    reference: |
      A feature map phi maps inputs to vectors in a Hilbert space F. 
      Each feature map gives rise to a unique Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS).
      The kernel function is defined as kappa(x, x0) = <phi(x), phi(x0)>.

    question: "How is the SVM dual problem formulated for quantum kernels?"
    concepts: ["Lagrangian", "Gram matrix", "alpha"]
    reference: |
      The dual form of SVM minimizes L(alpha) = sum(alpha_i) - 0.5 * sum(alpha_i * alpha_j * y_i * y_j * K_ij).
      K_ij is the Gram matrix where each entry is the inner product (fidelity) 
      between two input vectors in the quantum feature space.
