            "baseline_answer": "Quantum advantage refers to the ability of a quantum computer to solve certain problems faster than any classical computer. In the context of kernel methods, which are used for machine learning tasks such as classification and regression, quantum computers can potentially offer significant speedups over classical counterparts.\n\nKernel methods rely on the concept of kernels, which measure similarity between data points without explicitly computing distances or coordinates. This allows them to handle non-linear relationships effectively. However, the computational complexity of evaluating these kernels often limits their applicability to large datasets.\n\nClassical algorithms for kernel methods typically involve matrix operations that scale quadratically with the number of samples (N), making them impractical for very large datasets. Quantum computers, however, have the potential to perform these operations much more efficiently due to their inherent parallelism and superposition properties.\n\nIn principle, if a quantum algorithm could evaluate a kernel function in polynomial time relative to N, it would represent a quantum advantage. For example, Grover's search algorithm provides a quadratic speedup over classical algorithms for unstructured search problems. Similarly, Shor's algorithm offers an exponential speedup for factoring large numbers, which is relevant to many cryptographic applications.\n\nHowever, realizing this quantum advantage in practical scenarios requires overcoming several challenges:\n\n1. **",

In practice, coherent errors appear as over or under rotations of a quantum gate [16]. In the coherent approach every shot within the bound \u03f5 is random but consistent. This means that we get the same error for a gate operation every time for that particular run. This translates to a consistent miscalibration that causes distortion in the kernel matrix",
            "baseline_answer": "Coherent errors in quantum computing refer to the imperfections or disturbances that occur during the manipulation of quantum bits (qubits) and can lead to a loss of information. These errors are caused by various factors such as noise, decoherence, and imperfect control over qubits.\n\nQuantum computers rely on the principles of superposition and entanglement to perform complex calculations at an unprecedented speed compared to classical computers. However, these systems are highly susceptible to errors due to their delicate nature and the inherent limitations of current technology.\n\nTo mitigate these errors, researchers have developed error correction codes and algorithms designed to detect and correct errors before they propagate through the computation process. This ensures that the final results remain accurate despite the presence of errors during the execution of quantum algorithms.",
